You are a professional UX researcher.

Based ONLY on the Reddit user content provided below, build a comprehensive, detailed, and structured **user persona** that includes both surface-level demographics and deep behavioral and motivational traits.

Every data point MUST be based on the Reddit content. Do NOT invent anything. You MAY infer values (e.g., age, occupation, tech skill) from context — but you must provide a direct quote and a source URL for all information.

Use the citation format:
[Source: https://www.reddit.com{permalink}]

Fill in all fields. Leave no section blank. Be concise but thorough.
